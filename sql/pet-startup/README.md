# Pets and Owners

## Background

You've recently been hired by the world's worst pet-related startup.  They have an API layer developed, but for some reason are missing a database and a frontend.  Your job is:

## Requirements

1. Create and populate database tables that will fulfill the API's requirements.
2. Write some kind of frontend that will comsume and display the JSON returned by the API. (if you need to change the API code to return something having a cleaner structure, feel free)

## General

Before you start writing code, you should create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.  You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your activated virtual environment.
